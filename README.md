# PRAS BOOK API

Welcome to PRAS BOOK API, a platform aiming to provide access to a vast collection of books. While the ambition is to offer a comprehensive database, the reality is that a single individual may not be able to collect all the world's book information alone.

## Features

- Access a growing database of books covering various genres, authors, and publishers.
- Search for books using keywords, authors, genres.
- Retrieve detailed information about individual books, including titles, authors, descriptions, cover images, and more.
- Customize your API requests with advanced filters and parameters.
